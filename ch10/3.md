Given an input file with four billion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer which is not contained in the file. Assume you have 1 GB of memory available for this task.

bitmap.

**FOLLOW UP**
What if you have only 10MB of memory? Assume that all the values are distinct and we now have no more than one billion non-negative integers.
Make bucket.[1,10000] in bucket 1. [10001,20000] in bucket 2 and so on. In the second pass, just check every bucket.
